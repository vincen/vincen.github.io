In Gradle, building project which contains multi-module, there should be warning, because of code references.

> warning: Implicitly compiled files were not subject to annotation processing.
>   Use -implicit to specify a policy for implicit compilation.

To compile a set of source files, the compiler may need to implicitly load additional source files. (See [Searching For Types](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/javac.html#searching)). Such files are currently not subject to annotation processing. By default, the compiler will give a warning if annotation processing has occurred and any implicitly loaded source files are compiled. Using the javac option "-implicit" for ways to suppress the warning.

For more details, see [javac](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html), [searching for types and annotation processing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html#BHCJJJAJ), and [stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25701403/implicit-compiling-in-java).

In gradle, suppressing that warning, by adding the parameter in compileJava task

```groovy
compileJava {
    sourceCompatibility = jdkLevel
    targetCompatibility = jdkLevel
    // this parameter will pass to javac
    options.compilerArgs << '-implicit:none'
    options.encoding = encoding
}
```
