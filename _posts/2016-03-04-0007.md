# Martin Fowler 对于微服务的定义

In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These service are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

# 微服务架构的特性

- 每个微服务可独立运行在自己的进程里。
- 一系列独立运行的微服务共同构建起整个系统。
- 每个服务为独立的业务开发，一个微服务只关注某个特定的功能。
- 微服务之间通过一些轻量的通信机制进行通信。
